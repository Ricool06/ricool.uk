It feels good to be back at work. Since completing my placement as a software engineer, I have continued my studies at university. As much as the relaxed atmosphere of home working can be a welcome break after a hectic year of beginning my career as a software engineer, moving house twice, losing my motorcycle, and travelling around Europe, I always find myself itching to get back at it.

I'm currently taking a module, "Work Based Learning", where I document my experiences as a software engineer over 100 hours of industry placement. The idea is to show the ability to self-reflect, solve problems practically, act professionally within the law, and communicate effectively. And so, this post begins a series that should demonstrate my technical, interpersonal, and professional acumen. And if it doesn't, at least you, _the reader_, might be entertained by my attempts at writing English instead of Javascript for a change.

### What I did this week

#### Day 1
An early start 

The first day consisted mostly of formalities. To start, I had a chat with another student that is joining me in this placement while we were waiting to meet a member of HR, and we very quickly became friends. The day progressed quickly to the predictable ceremony of reading company regulations and signing forms. Next, we were taken on a tour of the building, primarily to be shown the fire exits, the bathrooms, and finally, our desks.

After our orientation, the nerve-wracking moment approached: it was time to meet the team. I needn't have been so anxious. Hand shakes and smiles all round, I already felt welcome in the venue for this new adventure for the next few weeks. My fellow student and I became part of a small team dedicated to investigating the best framework to use to replace an esoterically written monolith of code that the company had reluctantly relied on for one of their products.

To get us better acquainted with the problem at hand, some of the senior developers organized a meeting in which they presented the current product, the confusing and completely bespoke implementation, and the problems therein. Unsurprisingly, the principal of which was maintainability.

We finally got down to concrete work and started creating a backlog of work items that we will complete over the coming weeks. They encompass each requirement for the frameworks we will reviewing. The company had already compiled a list of requirements for the proposed tool, so this was more of an exercise in learning to use JIRA according to the company's agreed practice.

What followed was a two and a half hour train commute home. Lovely.

#### Day 2
The next day began with resolving some technical issues with my workstation. My team worked at the same PC in the morning, creating Angular components that would serve as the proof of concepts for the requirements of the first framework, [GoJS](https://gojs.net).

- Buiilding rapport with fellow student & teammates is gooood
- Clarification on whether I am an employeeee
- History of problem to understand solution and sensitivitiiieees
- Asking questions in meetingggg?
- backlog management with new companyyyy
- remote IT support then chasing down shows initiativeeeee
